# Library Book Management System

This React application utilizes React Router, Bootstrap, and Axios to create a simple CRUD interface for managing books and authors. It includes components for adding, editing, and deleting both books and authors. The code follows best practices, using Formik for form handling and Yup for validation.

# Book Information:
Each book record contains the title, author, ISBN number, and publication date.

# Home 
<img src="home1" />

# DashBoard
<img src="dashboard1" />

# AddBook
<img src="edit" />





# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:
